# Hekk

Can you write HTML using pure Swift? Maybe? Let's find out! A companion project to [Uut](https://github.com/lukesutton/uut).

## Please Note

* I don't know what I'm doing
* This isn't useful for real work yet
* It's not even a library!
* I would be happy to hear any suggestions, so feel free to open a ticket with comments or issues

## To Do

* [ ] Expand range of attributes
* [ ] Implement all the tags
* [ ] Allow custom tags to be defined

## Initial Support

The aim is to support the most common tags and attributes — common as defined by me :) — with additional HTML5 support.

The list of supported tags and their attributes will be:

* [x] html

* [x] link
* [ ] script
* [ ] body
* [ ] div
